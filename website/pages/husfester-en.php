<h2>House parties</h2>

<p>Twice a year FR Rotary arranges a traditionally theme-based party in Rotary Pub. FR Rotary's board members do all the work regarding cooking and serving, with magnificent results!

<p>The house party is subsidized with the purpose of strengthening the connections between the tenants. For a far too low price, a three course dinner with wine and long evening of fun is offered.

<p>The parties usually take place in April and November. If you live at Rotary you won't miss the posters that are put up—if you don't live at Rotary you can keep an eye on the news at this site when the time closes in for the party. People not living at Rotary are also invited.
