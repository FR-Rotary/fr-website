<h2>Become a board member</h2>

<p>The only requirement is that you must be a tenant at Rotary student housing, which automatically makes you a part of FR Rotary. Official election of the board is done during the biannual house meetings. It is preferred if the board members are available for a prolonged time, years if possible.

<p>In addition to the more specific positions within the board, one can be elected simply as a member, with the small difference that one doesn't hold a constitutional post of responsibility for a specific task.

<p>FR Rotary's main task is to contribute to a good social environment in the student housing and a commitment in the board shall be coloured of the same goal. The members of the board usually stay members until their departure from the area.

<p>The house meetings where official election is carried out usually occur in February/March and November.
