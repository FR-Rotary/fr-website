<h2>Contact us</h2>

<p>The recommended way of getting in touch is via e-mail. In case you see one of us in the area, it is of course no problem to speak with us directly.

<p>We also have a mail box in the C house which we check regularly. The tenants at Rotary can without trouble play mail carriers and save money on stamps. Non-tenants can give the task to a close-by post office to deliver their letter to:

<table class="post">
  <tr>
    <td>Förtroenderådet Rotary studenthem
  <tr>
    <td>Richertsgatan 2B-2000
  <tr>
    <td>412 81 Göteborg
</table>

<p>If you don't know which specific post of the board you want to contact, send an e-mail to the entire board.
