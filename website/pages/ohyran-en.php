<h2>Ohyran</h2>

<p>As an indication of FR Rotary's extensive history, the former board member Tomten has scanned some issues of "Ohyran", the (in Swedish) somewhat funnily named quarterly publication that was produced by FR Rotary a couple of decades ago.

<p>Notable notices are among others that

<ul>
  <li>you got 20:-/h more pay working in the pub in those days (that is, you got 20:-/h)
  <li>SGS did an SGS and raised the rent by 11.4% in 1980, another 9.77% in 1981 and another 9.1% in 1982 to the chocking level of 790:-/month for a single room
  <li>house parties in those days were profitable
  <li>Gothenburg City's answer to the question of whether someone lived in the spooky water tower was: "It is not possible to live there."
  <li>the A house of Rotary by Rotary's opening contained a health centre for students
  <li>the installations of new balcony doors began in 1982 and nearly is done.
</ul>

<p>With nuggets like that you obviously will want to learn Swedish and then read "Ohyran". Without further ado:
